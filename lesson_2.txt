What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the data structure to keep track of file changes. I need it to
	start working with version control on those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Not sure. It is a buffer to allow me to commit specific files in the directory
	and not all of its content. However, I understood before that the idea is to take
	a snapshot of all files when I commit. But maybe there are some files I would never
	want in my repository... and those are the ones I never include in the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
